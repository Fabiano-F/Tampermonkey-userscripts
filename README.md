## User Scripts

User scripts can improve your browsing experience, and open a lot of possibilities to make the sites you visit better by adding features, making them easier to use, or taking out the annoying bits.

To use user scripts you need to first install a user script manager. For Firefox, the best choice is [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/). For Chrome: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
